## What is 3DVR Portal?

The **3DVR Portal** is the entry point and central hub for the 3DVR community: a decentralized, open-source platform where people come together to:

- **Collaborate on open-source projects** in web, VR, gaming, hardware, and education.
- **Propose and launch new ideas and startups** in a supportive community.
- **Learn and grow skills** with access to mentors, tutorials, and collaborative coding.
- **Earn rewards and funding** for contributing meaningfully to projects.
- **Build the future** of open and ergonomic computing, decentralized communication, and community-driven hardware and software.

We are making tools and products **by the community, for the community** — and ensuring that anyone who participates can also benefit financially, socially, and professionally.

If you believe in empowering people to create together and own what they build — **welcome home.**
